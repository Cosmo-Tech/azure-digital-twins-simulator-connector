# NOTE: This connector makes use of the core Platform credentials to authenticate against the Azure Digital Twins API.
# This will not work if the Platform was deployed in the customer tenant,
# because the connector would need to use the credentials of a customer-provided app registration.
# In this case, please register the 'Connector_car.yaml' file instead.
